A special thanks to @aothms for enabling us with direct help and creating an awesome opensource community. Day one of the course will use several opensource components, and especially @ifcopeshell in jupytherhub setup. Everyone could setup their own jupytherhub by following @aothms guide here: [IfcOpenShell/ifcopenshell-jupyterhub](https://github.com/IfcOpenShell/ifcopenshell-jupyterhub). Illustrated below.
